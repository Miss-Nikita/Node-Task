*Class Project: Building a Backend Authentication System Using Express, Passport, and MongoDB*

In this project, you will build a backend application using the Express Generator. The application will include user authentication, allowing for Sign Up, Sign In, and Logout functionalities. You will use *Passport.js* for handling authentication and *MongoDB* for storing user data.

### Key Features:
- *User Authentication*: Implement Sign Up and Sign In functionality using Passport.js.
- *Profile Management*: Create a Profile page where the authenticated user can see their name displayed after logging in.
- *Session Management*: Implement Logout functionality to end the user session securely.
- *Data Storage*: Use MongoDB to store and retrieve user information, such as username and hashed passwords.

By the end of this project, you will have a fully functional backend application with authentication capabilities, providing a secure and user-friendly experience.
